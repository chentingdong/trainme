Monday:

Day 1: light swim in the morning (maybe 30 minutes just to get your heartrate up), hard track workout in the afternoon or brick workout if closer to race day.

Day 2: Bike intervals

Day 3: short but intense run, something like 4-5 miles at :30 over race pace. Could a medium swim this day too.

Day 4: rest

Day 5: light 20-30 min swim, long run 8+ miles and don't get more than a minute off your mile pace on miles 5+

Day 6: 25-45 miles on the bike, not crushing but not light. Should have a good burn at the end. This is where having a group is great.

Day 7: rest
